# diy-code
This is a remote repository which will link to my local repository. This repository will contain code-files that I think are eligible to be deemed projects and are worthwhile to share publicly. The repository is created with a vision and maintained with love.
Links to helpful tutorials, solutions and books will be kept in a special folder. You can access them freely!
